    "description": "With the onset of World War II, the restrictions imposed by treaties were no longer applicable, allowing for the development of cruisers without limitations. The new project, based on the Helena class, featured improved anti-aircraft armament while sacrificing one main battery turret. The ship's hull was widened to accommodate the increased weight and preserve stability. USS Cleveland participated in the landing of troops in North Africa, then was transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations, where she took part in numerous battles. Over the course of World War II, the ship was awarded 13 battle stars.",

She later participated in the campaign in the Solomon Islands, serving as an escort for aircraft carrier Hornet. During the course of the war, the ship was awarded 13 battle stars.",

During the battle off Cape Tassafaronga, a torpedo hit caused an explosion that severed part of her bow. After repairs, the ship participated in the landings on Saipan, in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, the Battle of Leyte Gulf, and the invasion of Okinawa.

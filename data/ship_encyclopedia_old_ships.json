    "description": "USS Enterprise, the second Yorktown-class carrier, played a role in raids on the Marshall Islands, in the Doolittle Raid, in the Battle of Midway, on the Santa Cruz Islands, and at Guadalcanal. After a major overhaul, the ship participated in virtually every campaign in the Pacific, with the exception of the Aleutian campaign. The aircraft carrier participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea and the Battle of Leyte Gulf. She also provided air support during the landings on Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The ship earned an impressive 20 battle stars throughout her years of service, which positioned her as the most decorated U.S. Navy ship of the war.",
